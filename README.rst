Testing with local streaming server
===================================

#. Start streaming server.

   .. code-block::

      $ (cd livego && go run . --level debug)

#. Create the application instance in the server (hard coded to 1234):

   .. code-block::

      $ wget 'http://localhost:8090/control/get?room=movie'

#. Start streaming with iOS app. Build and run the iOS application in
   xcode.

#. Watch stream in VLC:

   .. code-block::

      $ vlc rtmp://localhost:1935/live/movie

Ideas
=====

- Show latency, bitrate, resolution, protocol, ...

- Built-in support for commonly used streaming platforms (Twitch,
  Youtube, etc.).

  - Show number of viewers, chat, title, uptime, etc.

- LIDAR, altitude, geolocation.

- Picture in picture.

- Record to disk in different resolution than stream.

- Energy efficient.

- Streamlabs integration.

- Subscription and donation notifications. Both visually and with
  sound.

- Buffering for short disconnections. Show as picture in picture or
  other layout once reconnected. Possible a record button.

- Play music and short sound samples.

- Filters.

- Two-way video and/or audio.
